DESCRIPTION
-----------
i3Kornhe provides an alternative way to move and
resize windows in **i3**. It has some more
functions then the defaults and is more
streamlined. Resizing floating windows is done by
first selecting a corner of the window,  and then
moving that corner. See the wiki or the manpage
for details and how to add the required mode in
the i3 config file that is needed to use
**i3Kornhe**.
